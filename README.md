# Analysis of Publication Trends in Economics Journals (2005-2025)

## 1. Project Goal

This project aims to analyze the publication landscape of 30 prominent economics journals over the past two decades (2005-2025). The primary goal is to investigate the representation of authors affiliated with Chinese institutions and to identify how this presence has evolved over time and across different tiers of journal prestige.

The key research questions are:

- **How has the number of publications with China-affiliated authors changed in top economics journals since 2005?**

- **Is there a significant difference in the representation of China-affiliated authors between top-tier, mid-tier, and lower-tier journals?**

- **What are the most common economic subfields for articles with China-affiliated authors?**
